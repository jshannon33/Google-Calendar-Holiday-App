## Overview

Our team has decided to build an app that will provide the user with many categories to choose from, then based on the category choice it will give a quote from the Zen Quotes API and a gif with the same keyword from the Giphy API. The user will also be able to scroll through similar gifs with the same category.
​

### The challenge

Using two separate APIs to make an app, alongside a CSS library that is not Bootstrap.

### User Story

```markdown
AS A user
I WANT to select a category
SO THAT I can see a quote and a gif from that category.
```
