## Overview

Our team has decided to build an app that will allow the user to add holidays from countries around the world to their Google Calendar.
​

### The challenge

Using two separate APIs and a CSS library that is not Bootstrap, make an functional, responsive, interactive app.

### User Story

```markdown
AS A user
I WANT view my calendar and relevant holidays
SO THAT I can choose which holidays to add to my calendar.
```

## The process

1. The first thing we did was got an html file set up to use as a testing grounds for our APIs. During this time other team members began doing mockups for the page design.

2. After getting our API's working separately, we began working on getting them to work together.

3. Following this we began to style the page and then getting page itself functioning properly.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Bulma
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Google Calendar API
- date.nager API

### Continued development

- Our next goal would be to detect the users current country and input those holidays into their calendar automatically
- streamline the UX and api call functionality in javascript to foolproof the app and ensure no errors can occur
- utilize local storage to "remember" added holidays from previous visits to the app
